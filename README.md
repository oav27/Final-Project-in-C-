# Final-Project-in-C++
Final Project Created Based on Learnings of Abstract Data Structures


The problem that has been created is: assume that you are a streaming company, and you want to give movie recommendations to your customers based off of genres that they select for their movie preferences. So, with a prepopulated list of genres, and all the movies that fall under that genre, you need to be able to find all the movies that match all the genres that the customer wants to see in their movie recommendations.

 
   To give a small example:
   
Genre:             Movie Title:
Romance            The Proposal, The Notebook
Comedy             The Proposal, Twins
Horror             Us, Get Out, Hereditary


Let’s say the customer or user wants to see a movie that has a romance and comedy in it. With a prepopulated list of movies under each genre, you should write a function that will go through the genres, select the movies that are under each genre, and find the movies that match both romance and comedy. In this case, the function should return the movie “The Proposal.”
